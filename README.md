# READ THIS BEFORE USING THE EXAMPLE MOD

Thank you for using Moonstorm Shared Utils 2.0 for building your mod! We're glad you've chosen our framework.

This readme contains critical information about the folder setup of the MSU Example Mod.

# MSU EXAMPLE MOD

The MSU Example Mod is a boilerplate package that contains scripts for building and managing your Mod that utilizes MSU. The boilerplate only contains how to implement a basic Item that utilizes a Buff, but overall will contain how to use most of the utilities and functionality of MSU as a whole.

The custom classes bundled with the Example mod such as ``ItemAssetCollection`` where created inhouse for Starstorm 2, but we've decided to bundle it into the Example mod as well to facilitate the work for future mods.
