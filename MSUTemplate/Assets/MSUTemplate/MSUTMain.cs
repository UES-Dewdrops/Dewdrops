/*
 * Thank you for using Thunderkit and MSU to develop your mod, We hope this Template mod boilerplate aids your 
 * development pipeline.
 * 
 * Keep in mind that MSU expects the end user to know how modding RoR2 works, as such, these comments will work mainly 
 * to explain code from the MSU API and how it's used.
 * 
 * If you stumble upon a method or field that does not have a comment, try hovering over it! MSU has COMPLETE XML
 * Documentation which can come in handy.
 * 
 * These classes utilizes the C# feature for Conditional Compilation utilizing Preprocessor Directives. More info about
 * this system can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#conditional-compilation

 * Basically all key  names are written as "MSUTemplate" + X. Such as MSUTemplate namespace, MSUTemplateMain, MSUTemplateAssets, 
 * Etc. it is recommended to look thru the files and renaming the word "MSUTemplate" to fit your needs.
 * 
 * A common tactic used by the team behind MSU, is to make the namespace Explicit (IE: Starstorm2), and make any other
 * classes use an acronym suffix, such as "SS2" (IE: SS2Main, SS2Assets, etc).
